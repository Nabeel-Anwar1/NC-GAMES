<h1>Welcome to NC Games by Nabeel.<h1> 

This project was made using React, it includes a backend where I seeded my data on ElephantSQL and then hosted it on Render.

The frontend makes api calls to the database and is rendered on the website hosted on Netlify. 

I am using the free version of Render, this means that the instance will spin down when inactive. Therefore, when the site is loaded for the first time after some time of inactivity, it may take a while to show the data as the database is spinning up.
